## About DB
The demo is an example of creating an employed environment for building and running the Store web application. The Store is an MVC web application for accessing a sporting goods catalog. The functionality of the Store is restricted by following operations: browse the catalog, create, edit and delete entries in the catalog. The product catalog is a SQL database.

## Purpose 
Automating the process of creating a working environment using the example of the following infrastructure: Windows 2016 server, SQL EXPRESS server, IIS server. This infrastructure should provide verification of the functionality and build process of the web application (Store).

## Tools
* Vagrant v2.2.0
* VirtualBox v5.2.20

## Repository Folders 
Stor - sources of web-application
Packages - artifacts for building application with msbuild
Vagrant - scripts that orchestrate the process of the deployment and configuration of a virtual machine (VM) windows 2016 server, SQL server, iis server, build sources.
